## Repository that contains students' work for the OOP course 2019/2020

### Structure:
* problems - contains different problems that should be solved
    * practicum
    * seminars
        * excercise_tasks - contains excercise problems (optional)
        * homeworks - mandatory prolems that will be considered for the grades from seminars that everyone will receive
* student_work - contains all students' code. Every student should have separate folder in which he should add his work.

### Rules:
1. master branch is protected so every change must be made through pull request.
2. Students should touch only their folders
3. When opening PR, it should contain summary of the problems that are being solved. If a student tries to add solution to a problem that is not in this repository, he should provide link to the task.
